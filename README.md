# DownloadGator

### Simplest Web App to Start a file download remotely on the server. Could be used by college students who have limited internet access in their colleges to remotely put stuff to download on a server hosted at home(tv shows and stuff). Server can be hosted using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) and connecting it to a Telegram Bot can notify about Server activities

## How to Start ?

#### Dependencies:
1. Flask
2. Wget (built-in in linux, need to install on windows)
3. Python 3

Just run the `main.py` file and the server should start on `localhost:3000`
